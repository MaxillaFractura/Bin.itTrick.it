An app for shredding and cleaning up litter

I was inspired by Sam Pilgrim to make a little app that would match litter you find out in the world to bike and skate tricks.
The first Phase is to get a working web app prototype.

The second phase would be implimenting advanced features like sourcing images and gifs from the web to illustrate the tricks and the trash

Additionally I need to implement a more advanced probability system that matches harder tricks with less common/harder to dispose of
litter.

Some sort of web scraping to source new tricks and trick descriptions, as well as storing user difficulty ratings and user photo/video uploads. 

Gamification and social media integration is on the list, inparticular once the desktop version is fleshed out and I can port it over to Android and IOS
